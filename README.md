# Discrete-Event-Simulation-Implementation-of-BF-Algoriothm
Discrete event simulation implementation of the Bellman-Ford distance algorithm. Completed during the summer of 2020, one of many implemented programs under fellowship of Professor Qian from the University of California Santa Cruz

To run:
  1. Download files and open on terminal (cd Downloads -> cd Discrete-Event-Simulation-Implementation-of-BF-Algoriothm).
  2. Compile all files (javac *. java)
  3. Run the program (java Main)
  4. Manually input your graph starting with how many vertecies and edges your graph contains (press ENTER after each line)
  5. Add edges from your undirected graph
  6. Enter starting point. 
  
  This is a simplified form of the Bellman-Ford algorithm as there is not a topology generator. The objective is to show on a small scale how the algorithm works
  in a discrete-event fashion. By inputting the graph in manually, one is enabled to solve graphs by inputting the values of each edge and the connections each node 
  has to one another. The program will output the shortest distance from the starting node that was chosen as well as the previous vertex in which the shortest path
  came from.
